Business-PayPal-API version 0.02
================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   WPP_TEST=auth.txt make test
   make install

Please notice that this module requires you have several things before
you can test it:

  - a sandbox personal PayPal account
  - a sandbox business PayPal account
  - API credentials (either a certificate or signature)

Acquiring these things is your job, not mine. Read PayPal's
documentation to learn more.

If you do not set the WPP_TEST environment variable, sandbox tests
will be skipped.

The format of the authentication tokens file defined by WPP_TEST may
be found in the Business::PayPal::API documentation under "TESTING".
